!===== 

1. Folder "exp1_2"

a) file "zreg_exp1.csv": regionalized flow indices principal components for the 16 "target" catchments

b) file "zobs_exp1_2.csv": "observations" based flow indices principal components in the 92 catchments (for each "target" catchment the reamining 91 are used as "donor" catchments)

c) folder "z_sim_hydro_model": simulated flow indices principal componets derived from simulations provided by the ensembple of hydrological models FUSE

2. Folder "fid_r_summary": 

a) file "overall": fraction of identifications and reliability for each experiment accross catchments and processes

b) file "fid_r_exp3_4_accross_catch.xlsx": 
excel file with the following information accross the 16 target catchents and replicates per process:
(i) true positives, (ii) false positives, (iii) false negatives, (iv) fraction of identifications, and (v) reliability; for different dispersion factors
