### Folder `exp1_2/`

a) `zreg_exp1.csv`: regionalized flow indices principal components for the 16 "target" catchments

b) `zobs_exp1_2.csv`: "observations" based flow indices principal components in the 92 catchments (for each "target" catchment the reamining 91 are used as "donor" catchments)

### Folder `fid_r_summary/`

a) `overall.csv`: fraction of identifications and reliability for each experiment accross catchments and processes

b) `fid_r_exp3_4_accross_catch.xlsx`:
excel file with the following information accross the 16 target catchents and replicates per process:
- (i) true positives,
- (ii) false positives,
- (iii) false negatives,
- (iv) fraction of identifications, and
- (v) reliability; for different dispersion factors
